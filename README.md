# ATM Software System (ATMSS)

A software system emulating a bank ATM.
This was a group project with 4 contributors.
The system consisted roughly of 3 modules: logics of components, UI and database connection. I was responsible of the logics of components such as touchdisplay and keyboard, and I also contributed to the majority of debugging at the final stage.

Kindly note that the final version of this project resided in the *StevenDB* branch.
